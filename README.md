# AutoStatsQ

### Attention! Default branch is main, not master!

Toolbox for automated station quality control for MT inversion.
Please contact me for more information, help or when something does not behave as expected ;-) : gesap@gfz-potsdam.de

- Catalog search for teleseismic events with uniform azimuthal coverage around array
- Download of data & metadata for these events + computation of synthetic data
- Relative gain factors in time domain (relative to reference station or to synthetic data)
- Rayleigh wave polarization analysis for detection of sensor misorientations
- Comparison of obs. and synth. PSDs; determining frequency ranges suitable for MT inversion
- Test for large timing errors (resolution depends on sampling rate of synthetic data)
- Second independent and interactive test for exact and reliable amplitude corrections based on phase picking in snuffler and correlating waveforms

Latest changes
-------------
- New example config file with step-by-step tutorial in the ```example``` directory!
- Beautiful html report! After running AutoStatsQ, a html report file can be generated using ```--report```. The report is based on reveal (Copyright (C) 2020 Hakim El Hattab, http://hakim.se, and reveal.js contributors).
- Improved config file checks, feedback and error logging.
- new independent and interactive test for amplitude corrections based on waveform correlations of teleseismic P phases --> please contact me for detailed instructions, I didn't have time to document the work-flow yet. ;-)


Requirements
------------

- python3
- Seismology toolbox pyrocko: https://pyrocko.org/ (Heimann et al. 2017) (and all requirements needed for pyrocko)
- To compute synthetic data a pre-calculated GF database can be downloaded using `fomosto`. For instance, `fomosto download kinherd global_2s` from the pyrocko environment. https://greens-mill.pyrocko.org/
- for new interactive test: [Grond](https://pyrocko.org/grond/docs/current/) (from the pyrocko suite of applications).

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and openSUSE, using matplotlib version 1.5.1 (Hunter 2007) and gmt version 5.4.2 (Wessel et al., 2013). AutoStatsQ cannot run with gmt version 6.


To install gmt 5 from source, if your package manager only installs gmt 6, you can follow these instructions:
(1) First all dependencies are needed:
https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/wiki/Install-dependencies-on-Ubuntu-and-Debian

(2) Download (and extract) the gmt version package:
https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/releases/tag/5.4.5

(3) And you can follow the instructions here to install from source. I did not change any configuration files, but only followed the commands:
https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/blob/master/BUILDING.md



Download and Installation
-------------------------

- cd into the folder where you want to do the installation
- git clone https://github.com/gesape/AutoStatsQ
- cd AutoStatsQ
- (sudo) python3 setup.py install

Update
------
... AutoStatsQ is updated whenever new ideas are implemented or bugs found...

- cd into your AutoStatsQ installation directory
- git pull origin main
- (sudo) python3 setup.py install

Basic commands
--------------

show basic commands/ help:

	autostatsq -h


generate an example config file:

	autostatsq --generate_config

run 

	autostatsq --config name_of_config_file --run


To get detailed error/ info logging, use the -l option:


```
  autostatsq --config name_of_config_file --run -l INFO
```

Helpful for debugging: Forward terminal output into a logging file by using the option ```--logoutput FILENAME```.


To generate a html report after running AutoStatsQ:

```
  autostatsq --config name_of_config_file --report
```

The report is saved in a directory result_report and the file index_report.html can be opend for example with firefox.

Station list:
-------------

Lists of stations as input can be in pyrocko station format, as station-xml or as comma-spread-file with columns: network code, station code, latitude (float), longitude(float), station elevation [km], station depth [km]. Please use the file extensions 

Step-by-step instructions:
--------------------------

Please refer to the examples in the example dir for very detailed step-by-step instructions.

- make a working directory
- prepare station list for input
- generate a template config file (`autostatsq --generate_config GENERATE_CONFIG`) and adjust the settings
- it might be helpful to not run the toolbox in one run, but go though it step-by-step, setting the current step to `true` and the others to `false`... (`autostatsq --config my_config_file --run RUN`)

Output:
-------

Gain test:
- yaml files with median, mean and standard deviation of Ai,j/Ai,ref; i: event, j: station
- csv files with Ai,j/Ai,ref for all events and all stations
- optional: maps showing median log. Ai,j/Ai,ref for all stations and components
- optional: ...

Orientation test:
- yaml file with median, mean and standard deviation of obtained correction angle
- yaml file with polarity errors
- yaml file containing all results for all stations and single events
- optional: map showing the median correction angle; figures showing cc value vs correction angle for each event and station; figure showing correction angle over time for each station

PSD test:
- flat freq ranges in yaml file for each station and component
- optional: synth. and real PSDs
- optional: plots showing fit through PSD ratios


Small intro to the timing error test:
-------------------------------------

--> The other tests are described in detail here: http://doi.org/10.1785/0220180342


The small implemented check for timing errors is based on the cross-correlation between the recorded traces and the synthetic vertical traces: (1) First, for each event and station the two (syn. + obs.) traces are correlated to obtain the time shift for which the correlation is highest. (2) In a second step the median time shift of each event over all stations is determined and the time shift values at the single stations are corrected for this median value. This is done to avoid errors from wrong origin times in the catalog, to take into account large deviations between orgin time and centroid time, and to consider large path effects of the teleseismic test events which effect all stations in a similar manner.

The test is run in low frequency ranges (e.g. 0.01-0.10 Hz) and using synthetics computed from a global GFDB with a sampling of 2s. Therefore this test can only be applied to detect large timing errors in the order of several seconds. This error range is only useful to check prior to other seismological applications which use a similar frequency range as e.g. MT inversions.

The output is returned as a yaml file with mean, median, standard deviations and number of considered events. Additionally one figure shows the correlation matrices, before and after correction with the median of each event, and a second figure shows the obtained timing errors for each station.

For the input parameters please check the exemplary config file above.
